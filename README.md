# Schrodinger Equation Solver using FCNN (PyTorch)

This project uses a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) implemented in PyTorch to predict the ground state wavefunction of the 1D Schrodinger equation based on the potential, which the solution is generated by the numerical skills, include `imaginary time evolution` and `Runge-Kutta method`.

## Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation Summary

The time-independent Schrödinger equation, `Ĥψ(x) = Eψ(x)`, where `Ĥ = -ħ²/2m d²/dx² + V(x)` is the Hamiltonian operator, is used to find the stationary state wavefunctions `ψ(x)` and their corresponding quantized energies `E` for a particle of mass `m` in a potential `V(x)`. Solving this equation provides the allowed energy levels and the probability density `|ψ(x)|²` of finding the particle at position `x`. The ground state (`ψ₀(x)`, `E₀`) is the solution with the lowest possible energy, representing the system's most stable configuration.

## The Equation

**General Form:**

$$ \hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x) $$

**For a 1D Particle:**

$$ \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x) \right) \psi(x) = E \psi(x) $$

## Features

*   FCNN model built with PyTorch (`nn.Linear` and `nn.Softplus`).
*   Loads potential and wavefunction data from a CSV file.
*   Splits data into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) sets.
*   Trains the model using Adam optimizer with configurable learning rate and weight decay.
*   Implements early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.
*   Calculates and plots both training and validation loss curves (saved to `outputs/`).
*   Evaluates the final model on the test set.
*   Saves the best performing model state (`_best.pth`) or the final model state (`_final.pth`) to `outputs/`.
*   Plots example predictions against the ground truth for the test set, including the input potential (saved to `outputs/`).

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   PyTorch
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install torch numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

*   Place your training data CSV file (e.g., `NN_valid_data_schrodinger_1D_sol-Rx=3-Nx=128-num_data=25000-size_data=129.csv`) inside the `data/` directory.
*   Ensure the filename parameters (Rx, Nx, num_data, size_data) match those expected by the script/notebook.

### 2. Running the Python Script

*   Modify the `PARAMS` dictionary and `DATA_DIRECTORY` variable within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block in `schrodinger_FCNN_pytorch.py` to match your dataset and desired configuration.
*   Run the script from the project root directory:

```bash
python schrodinger_FCNN_pytorch.py
```

### 3. Using the Jupyter Notebook

*   Ensure the `data` directory with the CSV file is present in the project root.
*   Start Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook from the project root directory:

```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

*   Open the `notebooks/schrodinger_FCNN_pytorch.ipynb` file.
*   Modify the `PARAMS` dictionary and `DATA_DIRECTORY`/`OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` variables in the configuration cell.
*   Run the cells sequentially.

## Output

*   Trained model files (`.pth`) will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.
*   Loss plots and prediction plots (`.png`) will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.
